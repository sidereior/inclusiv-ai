# Generative Model API Concepts

Generative Models API Concepts
Provides information about using Generative AI models on Monster API

Monster API provides several pre-hosted Generative AI models.

The API requests operate asynchronously. This means that after a successful API request, you'll receive a process_id.

This process_id can then be utilized to retrieve results via the Fetch Results API.

Let's explore some of the API concepts below:

Authentication:
Monster API uses Bearer Token authentication.

Just include your API key in the Authorization Header for each API request.

API Request Body:
Monster API supports multiple Content Types in API request body, thus ensuring seamless integration with your workflows.

Supported Content-Types:

application/json
multipart/form-data
Requests made with any of the above Content-Type are treated same by our platform.

Use cases:
Send a JSON payload in API request:
cURL

curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/generate/falcon-7b-instruct \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <API Key>' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "prompt": "What is two + two?"
}
'
Send a file in API request:
cURL

curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/generate/whisper \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <API Key>' \
     --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data' \
     --form file=@audiofile.mp3 \
     --form language=en
❗️
File size is limited to 8 MB

If you want to use a larger file in your requests, then refer to the implementation below.

Send large files (> 8 MB) in API request:
By default, our APIs handle files up to 8 MB. For larger files, you can either send a publicly accessible file URL or use our Upload API. This API uploads your files to our S3 buckets and returns a download url. You can then use this URL in an API request to Generative AI APIs with an application/json payload.

The download URLs returned by Upload API are secure and valid for 30 minutes only.

Do checkout our Recipe on working with large files or refer File Upload API

File Upload > 8MB
Open Recipe
To use the uploaded files in your Gen AI API requests, refer to the specific AI Model API guides.

API Responses:
Our APIs returns a standard JSON format response. Each API call returns a process_id

JSON

{
  "callback_url": "",
  "message": "Request Accepted Successfully",
  "process_id": "aaaaaa-bbbbbb-cc-ggh",
  "status_url": "https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/status/aaaaaa-bbbbbb-cc-ggh"
}
You need to use Fetch Results API to retrieve status of your request or fetch final results.

This response also provides a status_url which can be used to fetch results. Simply use GET method to query this status_url with your API key set in Authorization header.

Webhooks:
Monster API provides an option to easily use a webhook URL as well.

Monster API provides an option to easily use a registered webhook as a callback.

Webhooks offer a powerful solution for developers:

Instead of manually polling the Fetch Results API, they can effortlessly receive automatic status updates on their API requests. This approach not only simplifies automation but also enhances scalability.

Pre-requisites for using a webhook:

Register a webhook URL on Monster API platform with a webhook name of your choice.
Pass the webhook in your Generative AI Model API requests using your webhook's name.
That's it. Now your webhook will start receiving your API request status updates.

Check out our Webhooks API to get started.

Also, you may explore this tutorial for a quick start:

Error Codes:
Monster API follows standard HTTP Error codes and verbs.

JSON

{
  "message": "Error Message"
}
HTTP Status Code Summary
HTTP Error Code	Definition
200 - OK	Everything worked as expected
400 - Bad Request	The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing a required parameter
401 - Unauthorised	No valid API key provided.
403 - Forbidden	The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.
404 - Not Found	The requested resource doesn't exist
408 - Request Timeout	Provided webhook is not responding and getting timeout out
415 - Unsupported Content	Unsupported file extension for a model
429 - Too Many Request	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. Please slow down or upgrade your plan.
500,501,502 - Internal Server Error	Something went wrong on our side
With all this information, let's get started with our first Generative Model API request!

Usage
Installation
You can install the monsterapi package using npm or yarn:

Bash

npm install monsterapi
or

Bash

yarn add monsterapi
Import the Library
To use the monsterapi library in your project, import the MonsterApiClient class:

JavaScript

import MonsterApiClient from "monsterapi";
or

JavaScript

const { default: MonsterApiClient } = require("monsterapi");
Initialize the Client
Create an instance of the MonsterApiClient class by providing your API key:

JavaScript

const client = new MonsterApiClient("your-api-key");
Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual Monster API key.

Get Response
You can use the get_response method to generate the Process Id of your request:

JavaScript

const model = "whisper"; // Replace with a valid model name
const input = {
  // Replace with valid input data for the model
};

client
  .get_response(model, input)
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle the status response from the API
    console.log("Generated Data:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle API errors
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
Check Status
You can use the get_status method to check the status of a Process Id:

JavaScript

const processId = "your-process-id"; // Replace with the actual process ID

client
  .get_status(processId)
  .then((status) => {
    // Handle the status response from the API
    console.log("Status:", status);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle API errors
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
Wait and Get Result
You can use the wait_and_get_result method it take process id and wait till status get completed and retrieve the result:

JavaScript

const processId = "your-process-id"; // Replace with the actual process ID

client
  .wait_and_get_result(processId)
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle the generated content result
    console.log("Generated content result:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle API errors or timeout
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
Generate Content
You can use the generate method to retrive the result directly without using each function separately. generate method Generate the process Id and Retrive it Result :

JavaScript

const model = "whisper"; // Replace with a valid model name
const input = {
  // Replace with valid input data for the model
};

client
  .generate(model, input)
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response from the API
    console.log("Generated content:", response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle API errors
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
Handle File Upload From Local Device
You can use the uploadFile method to handle file uploads from your local computer and use them in various model requests.

Using uploadFile in a Browser Environment (e.g. React, Next.js)
In browser-based environments, such as React or Next.js, you can use the uploadFile method as follows:

JavaScript

const model = 'img2img'; // Replace with a valid model name
const selectedFile = // Replace with your local file input

const response = await client.uploadFile(selectedFile); // Use the 'await' keyword to handle the Promise

const input = {
  // Replace with valid input data for the model
  init_image_url: response, // Use the response URL as the 'file' input
};

// Make a model request using the input
const generatedResponse = await client.generate(model, input);

// Handle the response from the API
console.log('Generated content:', generatedResponse);

Using uploadFile with Node.js
In a Node.js environment, the uploadFile method returns an object containing both the upload_url and download_url. You should perform the upload request directly to the upload_url API. Here's an example of how to use the uploadFile method in Node.js. For More Details Visit https://developer.monsterapi.ai/reference/get_upload:

JavaScript


const model = 'img2img'; // Replace with a valid model name
const selectedFile = // Replace with your local file input

const uploadResponse = await client.uploadFile(selectedFile); // Use the 'await' keyword to handle the Promise

// The response object contains the 'upload_url' and 'download_url' fields
const { upload_url, download_url } = uploadResponse;

// Now, you can use the 'upload_url' for direct file upload
// Perform an HTTP PUT request to 'upload_url' with the file content

// After successful upload, you can use the 'download_url' as an input in your model request
const input = {
  // Replace with valid input data for the model
  init_image_url: download_url, // Use the 'download_url' as the 'file' input
};

// Make a model request using the input
const generatedResponse = await client.generate(model, input);

// Handle the response from the API
console.log('Generated content:', generatedResponse);


// Please note that all files uploaded via the uploadFile function are automatically removed from the database after 30 Min for privacy and security purposes.

# Falcon-7B Instruct
Falcon-7B Instruct
POST
https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/generate/falcon-7b-instruct
Falcon-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-7B and finetuned on a mixture of chat/instruct datasets
It has been trained on 1,500B tokens of RefinedWeb enhanced with curated corpora and thus outperforms comparable open-source models (e.g., MPT-7B, StableLM, RedPajama etc.)

It works out of the box for instruction based text generation use-cases such as:
1.Copywriting
2.Summarisation
3.Code-writing
4.Classification
5.Sentiment analysis
and much more.

Falcon-7B-Instruct is mostly trained on English data, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.
Thus we recommend using it responsibly and with caution.

Make sure to use Fetch Results API after process_id is received

# Llama2-7B-Chat
Llama2-7B-Chat
POST
https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/generate/llama2-7b-chat
Llama2-7B-Chat is a 7B parameters generative text model built by Meta as part of the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), and has been fine-tuned for dialogue use cases. It was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources and further refined using over one million new human-annotated examples. The model does not include Meta user data in its training.

This model outperforms open-source chat models on most benchmarks tested and stands at par with popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM in human evaluations for helpfulness and safety.

It works best for dialogue and chat-based applications. However, being trained primarily on English data, it may not generalize well to other languages. Like most AI language models, it may reproduce stereotypes and biases present in the data it was trained on, so use responsibly and with caution.

# MPT-7B Instruct
MPT-7B Instruct
POST
https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/generate/mpt-7b-instruct
MPT-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by
MosaicML based on MPT-7B and
finetuned on a dataset derived from the Databricks Dolly-15k and the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (HH-RLHF) datasets.

The foundational model has been trained on 1T tokens of English text and code.

It works out of the box for instruction based text generation use-cases
such as:

Copywriting
Summarisation
Code-writing
Classification
Sentiment analysis
and much more.

This series of models have been trained on a dataset with biases and stereotypes filtered, unlike other models like Falcon. However, MPT may still output unexpected results from time to time, so we request you to use it with care.

Make sure to use Fetch Results API after process_id is received

# zephyr-7b-beta
zephyr-7b-beta
POST
https://api.monsterapi.ai/v1/generate/zephyr-7b-beta
zephyr-7b-beta is a language model with 7 billion parameters, designed as part of the Zephyr series of AI models. It's a refined iteration of the mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1, enhanced by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a blend of publicly available and synthetic datasets. The model shows improved performance on benchmarks like MT Bench and is adept at providing helpful responses.

While zephyr-7b-beta is capable of generating more dynamic text, users should be aware that without the in-built alignment of the datasets, there is a higher risk of producing problematic content. A technical report is available for those interested in the specifics of the training and finetuning process.

To interact with zephyr-7b-beta, send a prompt and optional parameters, then use the appropriate API to retrieve results.

MonsterAPI Deploy service deploy Opensource or private llm along with lora adapter with one request onto monsterAPI compute infrastructure.

Path to the base model can be a huggingface model. Needs to be a valid hugging face model.
Our service is based on vllm and any model supported by vllm is hence supported by this service.

Basemodels we have confirmed to work are as follow:

Falcon (tiiuae/falcon-7b, tiiuae/falcon-40b, tiiuae/falcon-rw-7b, etc.)
GPT-2 (gpt2, gpt2-xl, etc.) - Limited to 1xGPU
GPT-J (EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b, nomic-ai/gpt4all-j, etc.) - Limited to 1xGPU
GPT-NeoX (EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b, databricks/dolly-v2-12b, stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b, etc.)
LLaMA & LLaMA-2 (meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf, lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3, young-geng/koala, openlm-research/open_llama_13b, etc.) - lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3
Mistral (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1, mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, etc.)
MPT (mosaicml/mpt-7b, mosaicml/mpt-30b, etc.)
OPT (facebook/opt-66b, facebook/opt-iml-max-30b, etc.)
